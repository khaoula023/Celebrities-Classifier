# Celebrity Classifier Project

Welcome to the Celebrity Classifier project! This project aims to classify images of celebrities using various machine learning models. It leverages the power of machine learning to accurately identify and distinguish between different celebrity faces.

## Project Description:

This project involves building a classifier to recognize and classify images of celebrities using multiple machine learning models. The project includes the following steps:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment of the classifier

## Models Used:

The project uses the following machine learning models for classification:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Results

The results of the classifier are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. After training and testing the models, we found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model provided the best performance on our dataset.
